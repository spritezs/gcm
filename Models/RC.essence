given dataset : sequence of (set of int, int)

letting n be max([ x | (_, (xs, _)) <- dataset, x <- xs ])
letting options be domain int(1..n)

letting nbObservations be |dataset|

find score : int(0..nbObservations)

find rel : relation (partialOrder, total) of (options * options)

$ rational choice
such that nbObservations - score = sum (_, (s,c)) in dataset . toInt(forAll i in s . rel(c,i))
